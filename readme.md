# Overview

This is a two in one project. I created a youtube downloader that can save videos on your computer using pytube, a test program to ensure the code runs properly with pytest and a request library to help test the url. 

Also I created a shape drawer with the turtle library using Python classes. This program draws Polygons according to the size stipulated.

I wrote this program because I was curious how youtube downloaders online worked. I decided to make mine using Python. Also I was fascinated by Turtle and I plan on integrating these two projects in the future. A turtle GUI and pytube youtube downloader.
